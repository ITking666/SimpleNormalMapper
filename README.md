## Simple Normal Mapper

Simple Normal Mapper is a graphical editor with which one can generate normal maps for 2D images.

Normal maps are used, for example, in 2D games to make an illusion of
a 3D object.

## Building the project

Simple Normal Mapper is developed in C++/Qt so it can be built on any
platform that Qt5 runs on.

Please refer to the INSTALL document for build/install instructions if you're
going to build Simple Normal Mapper from sources.
