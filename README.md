Simple Normal Mapper is a graphical editor with which one can generate normal maps for 2D images.

Normal maps are used, for example, in 2D games to make an illusion of
a 3D object.

## Building the project

Simple Normal Mapper is developed in C++/Qt so it can be built on any
platform that Qt5 runs on. There are project files for `qmake` and `CMake`.

Building in CLI with CMake:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
